# Mobile-Dispatch.2


The original Mobile Dispatch application was built in 2015 and a prototype was developed to generate buzz at tradeshows. The original application was essentially translated from a desktop version meant for the ruggedized laptops in police units. The prototype did not garner the expected excitement. 

I began the re-design by starting from the very beginning; research. 

I wanted to understand what is was that we were trying to accomplish at the root. I worked with Police Chiefs, sat in dispatch centers and even road along with officers. 

After many conversations with users and many productive discussions with my team. We started with a map-centric approach.
